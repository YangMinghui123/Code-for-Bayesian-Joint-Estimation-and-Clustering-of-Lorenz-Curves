This repository contains code for the manuscript Bayesian Joint Estimation and Clustering of Lorenz Curves with Spatial Constraint.

data
simulation_design1_data.RData contains the simulation results for design 1.

simulation_design2_data.RData contains the simulation results for design 2.

select_parameter_for_real_data_data.Rdata contains the selected results of parameter lambda1 for real data.

figures_for_the_paper_data.Rdata contains the data of figures of several section in the paper.

code
genData.R contains the function to simulate survival data with exponential baseline hazard function, user-specified parameter vector, and tunable censoring distribution.

nulldata.R, alterdata1.R, and alterdata2.R contain the code to generate the dataset for the null setting where there is no spatial variation in the coefficients, and the two alternative setting where there exists spatial variation.

simunull.R contains the code to fit geographically weighted Cox models and local Cox models for the null dataset with no spatially varying coefficients using the great circle distance.

simalter_1.R contains the code to fit geographically weighted Cox models and local Cox models for alterdata1.RData (generated by alterdata1.R) using the graph distance.

process.R is a helper function to calculate the four performance measures for simulation replicates.
